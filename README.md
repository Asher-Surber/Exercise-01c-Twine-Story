Exercise for MSCH-C220, 27 January 2020

After you have tested your project in Twine and are happy with the result, tap on the name of the project (at the bottom of the window) to open the menu. Publish to File and save it in this repository as game.html.

In GitHub Desktop, you should now see main.py and game.json highlighted. Add a Summary message at the bottom of that panel, and push the "Commit to master" button. On the right side of the top, black panel, you should see a button labeled "Push origin". Press that now.

If you return to and refresh your GitHub repository page, you should now see that your files have been changed (with a new date).

Now edit the README.md file. When you have finished editing, commit your changes, and then turn in the URL of the main repository page (https://github.com/[username]/Exercise-01c-Twine-Story) on Canvas.

The final state of the file should be as follows (replacing my information with yours):
